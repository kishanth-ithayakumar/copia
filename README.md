## Getting Started
This is a demo repository to test with Github Copilot+

In Latin, the word for “copilot” is “copia”. The term likely originated from the combination of “co-” (meaning “together” or “with”) and “pilota” (meaning “pilot”). So, a copilot is someone who assists or shares the duties with the main pilot in operating an aircraft or other vehicle.
