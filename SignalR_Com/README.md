# SignalR_Com - Monitoring CPU Load and Memory Usage with a C# SignalR Application


## Introduction
In this guide, weâ€™ll build a small C# SignalR application that monitors CPU load and memory usage across all devices. SignalR allows real-time communication between clients and servers, making it ideal for tracking system performance.

## Prerequisites
